      <h2>Culture and History of Herat</h2>
      <p>
        Herat is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a history that
        dates back to over 2,500 years. It was once a key city along the Silk
        Road, connecting East and West, and has been a cradle of Persian
        literature, Sufi thought, and miniature painting.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Timurid dynasty in the 15th century, Herat reached the peak
        of its cultural and artistic development. It became a vibrant center for
        poets, scholars, architects, and artisans. The court of Sultan Husayn
        Bayqara and the presence of legendary figures like Alisher Navoi and
        Jami turned Herat into the "Florence of the East."
      </p>
      <p>
        Herat is also known for its carpet weaving, tile-making, and
        calligraphy. The traditional Herati motifs, colors, and patterns are
        unique and tell the story of a deeply artistic people rooted in
        spirituality and craftsmanship.

      <h2>Literature and Mysticism</h2>
      <p>
        Herat’s literary history is rich with Sufi poetry and philosophical
        writing. Figures like Khwaja Abdullah Ansari, known as "Pir-e Herat,"
        wrote in Persian and deeply influenced spiritual thought across the
        region. His works, filled with humility and divine longing, continue to
        be studied today.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city’s mystical heritage is reflected in its architecture, poetry,
        and way of life. Spiritual gatherings, music, and reflection were an
        essential part of Herati culture, especially during the classical
        period.
